## Intro

Bjarne Stroustrup is one of most well known computer scientists in the world having invented C++ in the 1980's. In 2020, C++ remains one of the pre-eminent programming languages on the planet; and I doesn't feel like it's going to go away any time soon despite many complaints about it, for example it's easy to find complaints about C++'s immense complexity on that Orange site. But you what Mr Stroustrup's response to that those complaints is? 

"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses". Yes. Again, I very much doubt that the sentiment is original. Of course, all "there are only two" quotes have to be taken with a grain of salt." see http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html



However, Bjarne admitted to making a "mistake" with C++'s design. The "mistake" he made has something to with Object-oriented programming, or OO programming for short. The "mistaken" design choice was __"extremely"__ fashionable at the time.

In this video, I will show you what the "mistake" was. And how Julia's avoided that "mistake" by embracing a feature that is rarely implemented in other programming languages.

## What's the mistake?
